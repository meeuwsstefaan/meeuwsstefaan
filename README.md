- 👀 I’m interested in Java software development and digital and analog hardware engineering. I hold a BSc degree (Belgian "Graduaat") in microprocessors and industrial design.
- 🌱 My favorite IDEs are IntelliJ IDEA 2021 2.3 and Eclipse. I also use TightVNC, Skype and other telepresence tools to allow remote development. It's as if I was in your office.
- 💞️ In particular I’m looking to collaborate on Java projects.
